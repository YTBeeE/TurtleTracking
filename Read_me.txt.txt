SeaTurtle.org posts tracking data for various individual turtles. These data are in a somewhat raw format derived from ARGOS satellite tracking systems. I have downloaded data for an adult loggerhead turtle, Sara, and our task is to develop code that can interpret Saraâ€™s raw tracking data. Specifically, we want to allow a user to specify a date and have our code report where Sara was seen on that date.
